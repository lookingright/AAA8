    <br>Our Story</h1>

  <p style="color:blue;text-align: center;font-size: 20px;">
    
    We started our business at early 90s as a retail fruit store with just one outlets. In late 90s, we had changed  our business strategy to become a wholesaler and distributor. 
    <br>Due to our dedication to deliver quality products and services, we are now one of the largest fresh fruit distributors in Hong Kong, Macau, Europe, and Australia; 
    <br>and to service customers including airline catering, foodservices, 5 stars hotels, bakeries and major supermarket chain stores. 
    <br>
    In 2007, we had expanded into our new 6 floor building premises, located at Chai Wan. The expansion gives easier access to Hong Kong sea port and Hong Kong airport. 
    <br>Each floor is equipped with its own facility including pre-packing, ripening, sorting, repacking, storage and logistics.
    <br>
    In order to meet the emerging needs of health products in Hong Kong and around the Global. 
    <br>We decide to target to high quality, high yielding and right ripeness level of fruits for different users and customers. 
    <br> We are increasing investment in food technologies to make sure to keep the original quality and taste of our products and prolong the shelf life. 
    <br> In January 2009, we have passed the IS022000 audit on top of HACCP accreditation, which means our production reaches the international food safety standard. 
    <br>In 2019, Fresh-cut moved into our new building premises. We bring in mechanization to improve efficiency and competitiveness.
